# Optical Flow Particle Field  

## By Matthew Gunther  


### To Do:

[ ] Build script within Docker
[ ] Link Perlin and OpenCV executables
[ ] Unit Tests





### Primary parts to develop
1. Lucas-Kanade flow from web cam input
2. Perlin noise particle flow field
3. Link LK flow vectors to flow field to allow user input to particle flow 

### Dependencies

OpenCV
Perlin Noise generator: https://github.com/Reputeless/PerlinNoise
